I'm a forth year undergraduate student from [School of CSTC](https://cstc.hrbeu.edu.cn/), [Harbin Engineering University](https://www.hrbeu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computer vision, person reid, diffusion model.

I'm very fortunate to have the opportunity to be advised by the brilliant and kind researcher Prof. [Cairong Zhao](https://vill-lab.github.io/) in Tongji University.
